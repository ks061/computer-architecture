1. mkdir -p ~/csci206/Labs/Lab01
2. cat concatenates files and prints them to the standard output.
   
   more allows the user to page through content one 'screenful' at a time.
   
   less is like the more command but allows for backward and forward movement
   in the file.

   head outputs the first part of files.

   tail outputs the last part of files.

3. emacs -nw
4. :set number
5. M-x linum-mode
6. After careful consideration, I will use vim in csci206 as my text editor.
