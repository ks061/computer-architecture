notes: This text file contains
       responses to questions
       involving taking notes
       on particular C
       commands via reading
       their respective manual
       pages.

Exercise 2

creat creates file if that said file does not exist at the given pathname. 
If the file already exists at that pathname, the file will be truncated 
and can only be written to. The command ultimately returns a file 
descriptor, which is lowest-available nonnegative integer referring to 
a specific file. Such unique numbers are assigned to files that are open 
for the currently running process. 

open opens a file at the given pathname. The command ultimately returns
the lowest-available nonnegative integer referring to a specific file. 
Such unique numbers are assigned to files that are open for the 
currently running process.

read reads bytes of data from the file represented by the inputted
file descriptor and stores them in memory starting at the inputted
buf. It returns the number of bytes that have been read; if an
error occurs whilst reading the file, -1 is returned.

write writes bytes of data from memory starting at the inputted buf 
to the file represented by the inputted file descriptor. It returns
the number of bytes that have been written; if an error occurs
whilst writing the file, -1 is returned.

close closes the file represented by the inputted file descriptor. After
a file has been closed, the file descriptor no longer refers to a
particular file and, hence, is avaiable to be used to refer to another
file. It returns 0 on successful closure of the file; if an error
occurs whilst closing the file, -1 is returned.
