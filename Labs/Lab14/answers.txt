2.1: Increasing block size increases conflict misses because once it becomes
     a significant portion of the cache size, there will be more blocks
     competing for the same space. The data agrees with this assertion;
     increasing the block size from 8 bytes to 64 bytes increased the 
     conflict misses from 17,499 to 20,659.  Also, the compulsory misses 
     decreased from 19,486 to 3,306 when the block size was increased from
     8 bytes to 64 bytes because spacial locality preloaded the data near
     past memory references. 

2.2: Doubling the size of the cache (from 8K to 16K) increases the number
     of indices where blocks can be stored, and therefore reduces the capacity
     misses. This can be seen by the decrease in capacity misses from 32,088
     to 13,339.

2.3: Compulsory misses are not replaced by conflict misses (we can see this because
     the amount of compulsory misses stays constant at 6,216 from cache size 32 KB
     until cache size 512 KB) because the total capacity of the cache is much larger
     than the amount of data being stored in the cache. Because the cache size increases,
     capacity misses decrease from 933 to 0 because there are more indices where
     blocks can be stored. Also, conflict misses decrease because there is less competition
     for cache space among blocks now as the cache size increases; conflict misses
     decreased from 1,239 to 64 when cache size increased from 32 KB to 512 KB.

2.4: There are slightly more capacity misses that occur when increasing
     the associativity from 1, 2, then 4, i.e. from 32088, 32338, and then
     32742. The number of conflict misses significantly increases from 17499,
     25991, and then 45140. There is much data competing for storage in
     a relatively small cache, i.e. only of size 8 KB.

2.5: Compulsory misses are not replaced by conflict misses (we can see this because
     the amount of compulsory misses stays consistent at 19,486 from associativity
     1, 2, and then 4) because the total capacity of the cache is much larger than the
     amount of data being stored in the cache; the 8 KB cache in 2.4 simply did not have
     enough space to store data in the cache hence why there were more misses. Capacity
     misses were significantly lower also because the total capacity of the cache is much
     larger than the amount of data trying to be stored in the cache. Finally, the number of
     conflict misses was substantially lowered with increased associativity (and block size
     relative to 2.4) because associativity increases the number of possible places that data
     can be stored if a potential conflict arises.
